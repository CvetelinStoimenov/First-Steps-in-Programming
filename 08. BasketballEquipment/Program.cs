                • Basketball team – its price is 20% cheaper than that of sneakers
                • Basketball – its price is 1 / 4 of the price of the basketball team
                • Basketball accessories – their price is 1 / 5 of the price of the basketball

                    Price of basketball accessories: 1 / 5 from 43.80 = 8.76
                    Total price for the equipment: 365 + 219 + 175.20 + 43.80 + 8.76 = 811.76

                    Price of basketball sneakers: 550 – 40% = 330
                    Price per basketball team: 330 – 20% = 264
                    Basketball price: 1/4 of 264 = 66
                    Price of basketball accessories: 1 / 5 from 66 = 13.20
                    Total price for the equipment: 550 + 330 + 264 + 66 + 13.20 = 1223.2
