            Rumen wants to repaint the living room and has hired craftsmen for this purpose. Write a program that calculates the cost of the repair, 
            taking the following prices for the calculation:
            · Protective nylon - 1.50 BGN per square meter
            · Paint - 14.50 BGN per liter
            · Paint thinner - 5.00 BGN per liter

            Just in case, to the necessary materials, Rumen wants to add another 10% of the amount of paint and 2 square meters of nylon, also 0.40 leva for bags.
            The amount paid to the craftsmen for 1 hour of work is equal to 30% of the sum of all material costs.

            Input
            The input is read from the console and contains exactly 4 lines:
            1. Required amount of nylon (in sq.m.) - an integer number in the range [1... 100]
            2. Required amount of paint (in liters) - an integer number in the range [1... 100]
            3. Quantity of thinner (in liters) - integer number in the range [1... 30]
            4. Hours needed for the craftsmen to do the work - an integer number in the range [1... 9]

            Output
            Print out only one line on the console:
            · "{the sum of all costs}"
