                The school year has already started and the 10B grade manager - Annie has to buy a certain number of packets of pens, packets with markers, as well as board cleaner. She is a regular client of a bookstore, so there is a discount for her, which represents some discount percentage of the total amount. Write a program that calculates how much money Annie will need to collect to pay the bill, keeping in mind the following price list:

                • Package of pens - 5.80 lv.
                • Package of markers - 7.20 lv.
                • Board cleaner - 1.20 BGN (per liter)

          Input
                From the console read 4 numbers:

                · Number of packages of pens - integer in the range [0...100]
                · Number of packets of markers - integer in the range [0...100]
                · Liters of board cleaner - an integer in the range [0... 50]
                · Discount percentage - integer in the range [0...100]

          Output

                Print on the console how much money will Annie need to pay the bill.

                 Output 28.5

                Price of packages of pens => 2 * 5.80 = 11.60 BGN 
                Price of marker packages => 3 * 7.20 = 21.60 BGN 
                Price of the board cleaner => 4 * 1.20 = 4.80 BGN 
                Price for all materials => 11.60 + 21.60 + 4.80 = 38.00 BGN 
                Calculating the discount 25% = 0.25 
                Price after discount = 38.00 – (38.00 * 0.25) = 28.50 BGN
